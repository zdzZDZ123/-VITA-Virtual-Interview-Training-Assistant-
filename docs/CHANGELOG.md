# CHANGELOG

All notable changes to VITA (Virtual Interview & Training Assistant) project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased] - 2025-06-19

### Added
- **Backend**:
  - Created unified `requirements.txt` for dependency management
  - Added `pyproject.toml` for whisper package configuration
  - Implemented structured logging with `loguru` in `core/logger.py`
  - Added request tracking middleware with trace_id generation in `core/middleware.py`
  - Performance monitoring middleware for slow request detection
  
- **Frontend**:
  - Created modular components:
    - `WebcamView.tsx` - Standalone webcam management component
    - `ConversationPanel.tsx` - Message history display component
  - Added frontend logger utility in `utils/logger.ts`
  - Implemented Playwright E2E test configuration
  - Created comprehensive E2E test suite for digital human interview flow
  
- **CI/CD**:
  - Comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):
    - Code quality checks (Ruff, Black, isort, MyPy, ESLint)
    - Backend unit tests with coverage
    - Frontend tests and build verification
    - E2E tests with Playwright
    - Security vulnerability scanning with Trivy
    - Docker image building and pushing

### Changed
- **Repository Structure**:
  - Updated `.gitignore` to exclude:
    - `backend/venv/` and all virtual environments
    - `*.pkl` cache files
    - `backend/cache/` directory
  - Renamed conflicting `test_api.py` to `test_api_root.py`

### Fixed
- **Backend**:
  - Resolved Python package import issues for whisper tests
  - Fixed test file naming conflicts causing pytest import errors
  
- **Frontend**:
  - Fixed TypeScript linting errors in new components
  - Resolved type safety issues with proper type annotations

### Removed
- Cleaned up repository:
  - Removed `backend/venv/` directory (should not be version controlled)
  - Removed cached `.pkl` files

### Technical Debt Addressed
1. **Dependency Management**: Centralized all backend dependencies in `requirements.txt` with specific versions
2. **Component Architecture**: Started refactoring monolithic `DigitalHumanInterviewRoom.tsx` into smaller, focused components
3. **Logging**: Implemented structured logging for better observability
4. **Testing**: Set up E2E testing infrastructure with Playwright

### Migration Notes
- Developers need to create a fresh virtual environment and install dependencies:
  ```bash
  cd backend
  python -m venv venv
  venv/Scripts/activate  # On Windows
  # or
  source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  pip install -e whisper-main/whisper-main/
  ```
  
- Frontend developers need to install new dependencies:
  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npm install
  npx playwright install --with-deps
  ```

### Known Issues
- PyTorch installation might require manual configuration for CPU-only builds
- Some E2E tests require backend API to be running
- Network connectivity issues may affect npm package installation

### Next Steps
1. Complete frontend component refactoring
2. Implement Redis caching layer
3. Add more comprehensive unit tests
4. Set up production deployment pipeline
5. Implement performance metrics dashboard
